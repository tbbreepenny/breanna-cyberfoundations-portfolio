# Week 3 Lab 02 — Two Shells, Same Job: Incident Response Edition (CLI Simulator)

**Student Name:** BREANNA PENNYWELL

**Date Completed:** 09/06/2026

**Module:** 1 — Digital Infrastructure & CLI | **Week:** 3  
**Submission Path:** `week-03/labs/lab-02-two-shells-same-job.md`

## Overview

Welcome to your first Incident Response (IR) assignment in the **Foundry District Storeroom**. Our network monitoring system has flagged a potential unauthorized file access attempt on our storage systems, and you've been asked to investigate from two angles: first by connecting to a remote Linux database server (Pass A, in bash), then by sitting down at a Windows admin workstation examining that exact same shared storage (Pass B, in PowerShell). Your goal is to confirm the files look the same from both operating systems and that the directory tree matches — the same translation skill from Lesson 2, now applied to a real-feeling scenario instead of just a comparison slide. You'll also log your own findings along the way, using the create-and-organize commands from Lesson 3C — a real investigator never just looks and remembers, they document.

**Nothing here can break anything real.** Same consequence-free CLI Simulator as Lab 01.

## 💡 Pro-Tips for Reducing Keyboard Strain

Before you start typing, remember these three professional efficiency "cheat codes":

- **Tab Completion (the autocomplete magic):** you don't need to type out long folder names — type the first few letters (e.g., `cd rep`) and press **Tab**. The shell will instantly autocomplete the folder name, in both bash and PowerShell.
- **Up Arrow (the recaller):** if you make a typo, don't retype the whole command — press the **Up Arrow** to recall your last command, use the left/right arrows to fix the typo, and hit **Enter**.
- **PowerShell aliases:** if typing `Get-Location` or `Get-ChildItem` feels too long, PowerShell lets you use `pwd` as a shortcut for location, and `ls` or `dir` for listing files.

## Part A — The Bash Pass (Linux Remote Server)

Connect to the **remote Linux terminal** in the CLI Simulator and execute the following investigative steps. Record your commands and output exactly as they appear.

### Step A1 — Verify Your Starting Location

Run the command to print your current working directory.

Command you ran:

```
pwd
```

Output:

```
agent@storeroom-lnx01:/home/agent$ pwd
/home/agent
```

### Step A2 — Look Around the Directory

List the contents of your current location to spot any files or folders.

Command you ran:

```
ls
```

Output:

```
agent@storeroom-lnx01:/home/agent$ ls
README.txt  archive

```

### Step A3 — Move Deeper into the Storeroom

Choose a folder from the list and use the change directory command to move inside it.

Command you ran:

```
agent@storeroom-lnx01:/home/agent$ cd archive/incident-42
```

**⚠️ Stop and check:** run your location-check command *immediately* after moving, to confirm you arrived safely.

Command you ran:

```
agent@storeroom-lnx01:/home/agent/archive/incident-42$ pwd

```

Output:

```
/home/agent/archive/incident-42
```

### Step A4 — Inspect the Incident Log File

Find a text file in this directory and print its contents to the screen to peek inside.

Command you ran:

```
agent@storeroom-lnx01:/home/agent/archive/incident-42$ cat access-log.txt
```

Output:

```
Access Log - Incident 42
03:14 - Unknown login attempt, storeroom bay 3.
03:16 - Access denied.
03:17 - Alert raised to on-call.
```

### Step A5 — Create Your Investigation Note

Investigators document as they go. Create a new, empty file right here called `investigation-notes.txt` to hold your findings.

Command you ran:

```
touch investigation-notes.txt
```

### Step A6 — Back Up Your Note

Before you go any further, make a backup copy of `investigation-notes.txt` called `investigation-notes-backup.txt`, in case anything happens to your original.

Command you ran:

```
agent@storeroom-lnx01:/home/agent/archive/incident-42$ cp investigation-notes.txt investigation-notes-backup.txt
```

Confirm both files now exist:

```
agent@storeroom-lnx01:/home/agent/archive/incident-42$ ls
access-log.txt  investigation-notes-backup.txt  investigation-notes.txt
PS /home/agent/archive/incident-42>

```

## Part B — The PowerShell Pass (Windows Admin Workstation)

Now switch your simulator tab to **PowerShell**. You are examining the same shared storage room from a Windows administrative workstation. **You must target the exact same folder and file you used in Part A.**

### Step B1 — Verify Your Starting Location

Run the Windows command to print your current location.

Command you ran:

```
Get-Location
```

Output:

```
/home/agent
```

### Step B2 — Look Around the Directory

List the contents of your current location.

Command you ran:

```
Get-ChildItem
```

Output:

```
PS /home/agent> Get-ChildItem
Mode                 Name
d-----               archive
-a----               README.txt
PS /home/agent>
```

### Step B3 — Move Deeper into the Storeroom

Move into the **exact same folder** you chose in Part A.

Command you ran:

```
Set-Location archive/incident-42
```

**⚠️ Stop and check:** run your location-check command *immediately* after moving, to confirm you arrived safely.

Command you ran:

```
Get-Location
```

Output:

```
PS /home/agent> Set-Location archive/incident-42
PS /home/agent/archive/incident-42> Get-Location
/home/agent/archive/incident-42
```

### Step B4 — Inspect the Incident Log File

Print the contents of the **exact same text file** you read in Part A.

Command you ran:

```
Get-Content access-log.txt
```

Output:

```
PS /home/agent/archive/incident-42> Get-Content access-log.txt
Access Log - Incident 42
03:14 - Unknown login attempt, storeroom bay 3.
03:16 - Access denied.
03:17 - Alert raised to on-call.
```

### Step B5 — Create Your Investigation Note

Create the **same-named** empty file, `investigation-notes.txt`, right here on the Windows side.

Command you ran:

```
New-Item investigation-notes.txt
```

### Step B6 — Back Up Your Note

Make a backup copy of `investigation-notes.txt` called `investigation-notes-backup.txt`, same as you did in Part A.

Command you ran:

```
Copy-Item investigation-notes.txt investigation-notes-backup.txt
```

Confirm both files now exist:

```
PS /home/agent/archive/incident-42> ls
Mode                 Name
-a----               access-log.txt
-a----               investigation-notes-backup.txt
-a----               investigation-notes.txt
PS /home/agent/archive/incident-42>

```

## Part C — Side-by-Side Comparison (Spot the Difference)

### Step C1 — The Command Comparison Table

Fill in the exact commands you typed for each task. Do not use generic names — list what you actually executed.

| Task / Question | Bash Command (Linux Pass) | PowerShell Command (Windows Pass) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Where am I? | pwd | 	Get-Location |
| 2. Look around | ls | Get-ChildItem |
| 3. Move into a folder | cd archive/incident-42 | Set-Location archive/incident-42, then Get-Location. |
| 4. Peek inside a file | cat access-log.txt | Get-Content access-log.txt |
| 5. Create + back up your note | touch investigation-notes.txt then cp investigation-notes.txt investigation-notes-backup.txt | New-Item investigation-notes.txt |

**⚠️ Stop and check:** did you use the exact same folder and file for both your bash and PowerShell passes? If they don't match, your comparison table below won't make sense — go back to Part B and re-target the same location before continuing.

### Step C2 — Output Differences Reflection

Describe at least one difference in how the two shells presented information to you (e.g., column layout, text colors, file details, folder headers). Minimum 2 sentences.

```
Both shells listed the same three files, but ls printed them as a plain space-separated line with no other information, while Get-ChildItem displayed them in a formatted table with columns like Mode, LastWriteTime, and Length. This meant PowerShell gave me extra metadata about each file automatically, whereas in bash I'd need to add a flag like -l to ls to see similar details.
```

## 🧠 Analysis Questions

### Analysis Question 1 — The Identical Tree

How do you know that the underlying file system tree was identical across both passes, even though you used completely different commands and operating systems? Point to concrete evidence from your terminal outputs (e.g., matching folder names, file content, or sizes). Minimum 3 sentences.

```
I know the underlying file system tree was identical across both passes because the folder path matched exactly: both pwd and Get-Location confirmed /home/agent/archive/incident-42 as the destination after moving. The file names inside that folder were also identical between passes — access-log.txt, and later investigation-notes.txt and investigation-notes-backup.txt — which wouldn't be possible if the two passes were looking at different data. Finally, the actual content of access-log.txt was the same in both cases (the same incident log text about the unknown login attempt), which confirms the commands were just two different interfaces pointed at the same real data, not two separate simulated environments.
```

### Analysis Question 2 — Syntax Preferences

Which command pair (e.g., pwd vs. Get-Location, ls vs. dir, cat vs. type) felt most different to you? Give a specific reason why one felt more comfortable or intuitive than the other. Minimum 3 sentences.

```
The command pair that felt most different to me was pwd vs. Get-Location / ls vs. Get-ChildItem. "Get-Location" felt more descriptive/self-explanatory than the terse "pwd," or "ls" felt faster to type than "Get-ChildItem".  Shorter commands are quick to memorize.
```

### Analysis Question 3 — Applying Lesson 2 Differences

Describe how a specific difference you learned about in Lesson 2 (such as slash styles, case-sensitivity, or drive letters) was directly visible in your hands-on commands or output during this lab. Minimum 3 sentences.

```
One difference from Lesson 2 that showed up directly in this lab was slash style: both my bash and PowerShell outputs used forward slashes, printing the path as /home/agent/archive/incident-42 in both pwd and Get-Location. This is easy to remember because on a real Windows machine, PowerShell paths are usually written with backslashes and start with a drive letter, but this simulated environment kept a Linux-style path structure even on the "Windows pass." That told me the difference between the two shells here was really about command syntax and naming (ls vs. Get-ChildItem, cat vs. Get-Content), not about the underlying path format, since neither a drive letter nor a backslash ever appeared in my output.
```
