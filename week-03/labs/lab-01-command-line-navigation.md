# Week 3 Lab — Navigate Your First File System (CLI Simulator)

**Student Name:** BREANNA PENNYWELL

**Date Completed:** 10/01/2026

**Module:** 1 — Digital Infrastructure & CLI | **Week:** 3  
**Submission Path:** `week-03/labs/lab-01-command-line-navigation.md`

## Overview

Lesson 3 introduced your first five commands — finding where you are, looking around, moving through folders, peeking inside a file, and asking for help — in both bash and PowerShell. This lab has you apply those same five commands to a brand-new practice area inside the CLI Simulator, on your own, then connect what you find back to the file-system tree you learned to read in Lessons 1 and 2.

**Nothing here can break anything real.** The CLI Simulator is a consequence-free practice space — if you type something wrong, the worst outcome is an error message telling you so.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Environment | CyberFoundations CLI Simulator (browser-based, inside the Lab Portal) — no install, no VM, no real terminal required |
| Shell | Your choice — bash or PowerShell. Try the same steps in both if you want extra practice; only one is required |
| Prerequisite | Lessons 1, 2, and 3 completed |

**Before you start:** here is how to open this lab's practice area.

1. Sign in to the Lab Portal and open **CLI Simulator** (in the top menu, or the **Open the CLI Simulator** link on the Week 3 page).
2. Scroll down to the heading **Week 3 Labs**.
3. Pick **one** box: **Foundry District Shift Log — Bash** or **Foundry District Shift Log — PowerShell**. Each box is its own terminal. There is no separate shell switch — the box you pick decides the shell.
4. Click inside the terminal and type your commands there.

**How the challenges work.**

- The box shows **Challenge 1 of 6**, **Challenge 2 of 6**, and so on. Each worksheet step below tells you which challenge it matches.
- Read the challenge goal, type commands until it is met, then press **Next** (or press Enter on an empty line). Use **Previous** any time to look back at an earlier challenge.
- **Each challenge loads its own prepared files and its own starting folder.** The terminal still shows your earlier commands, but your location and files reset to that challenge's setup. This is normal — it is not lost work.
- **Good habit:** at the start of every new challenge, run `pwd` (bash) or `Get-Location` (PowerShell), then `ls` (bash) or `dir` (PowerShell), so you know where you are and what is there.
- **Restart challenge** gives you fresh files for the current challenge. It does **not** remove challenges you already completed and saved.
- Only commands that run without an error count toward a challenge. If you see an error, read it and try again.
- The simulator saves your challenge progress. Your worksheet answers are separate — save them on this worksheet page.

**Command reference:** at the top of the CLI Simulator page, click **Command reference** to open it. You can search by command name or by task (for example "list" or "help") and filter to **Bash** or **PowerShell**. Its examples use sample file names that may not exist in your challenge — always check with `ls`/`dir` first.

## Part A — Find Your Way

### Step 1 — Check Your Starting Point

**Matches Challenge 1.** Run the command that tells you where you currently are (`pwd` in bash, `Get-Location` in PowerShell).

Command you ran:

```
pwd
```

Output (your current path):

```
/home/morgan
```

### Step 2 — Look Around

**Matches Challenge 2.** Run the command that lists what's in your current location (`ls` in bash, `dir` or `Get-ChildItem` in PowerShell).

Command you ran:

```
ls
```

Output (files/folders listed):

```
README.md  intake  logs  maintenance
```

### Step 3 — Predict Before You Move

**Do this before you press Next into Challenge 3.** Look at the folder names from Step 2 and guess which one might contain a shift log or notes file. Write your guess down first — you'll check it in Part B.

My guess:

```
logs
```

---

## Part B — Move and Peek

### Step 1 — Move Into a Folder

**Matches Challenge 3 (first half).** Challenge 3 starts in your home folder. Use `cd` (bash) or `cd`/`Set-Location` (PowerShell) with a folder name from Part A, Step 2 to move into the folder you guessed.

Command you ran:

```
cd logs
```

### Step 2 — Confirm Your New Location

**Matches Challenge 3 (second half).** Right after moving, run `pwd` or `Get-Location` to confirm exactly where you landed. Challenge 3 is complete only when you move **and then** check.

Command you ran:

```
pwd
```

Output (your new path):

```
/home/morgan/logs
```

### Step 3 — Look Around Again

**Matches Challenge 4 (searching).** Challenge 4 starts fresh in your home folder again — not in the folder from Challenge 3. Run `pwd`/`Get-Location` to check, then use `cd` and `ls`/`dir` to look inside the folders until you find the file that logs today's activity.

Command you ran:

```
pwd
ls
cd logs
pwd
ls
```

Output:

```
/home/morgan
README.md  intake  logs  maintenance
/home/morgan/logs
shift-log.txt
```

### Step 4 — Peek Inside the File

**Matches Challenge 4 (reading).** Once you've found the log file, use `cat` (bash) or `type`/`Get-Content` (PowerShell) to read its contents. Was your guess from Part A, Step 3 right?

Command you ran:

```
cat shift-log.txt
```

File contents:

```
Shift Log - Foundry District
06:00 - All systems nominal.
14:00 - Routine inspection complete.
22:00 - Handoff to night shift.
```

### Step 5 — Move Back Up

**Matches Challenge 5.** Challenge 5 starts you inside a folder below home (run `pwd`/`Get-Location` to see where). Your goal is to return to your home folder, `/home/morgan`. Use `cd ..` (in bash, plain `cd` also works), then confirm with `pwd`/`Get-Location` that you are in `/home/morgan`.

Command you ran:

```
cd ..
```

Output (confirming your new — higher — location):

```
/home/morgan$

```

---

## Part C — Ask for Help

### Step 1 — Pick an Unfamiliar Command

**Matches Challenge 6.** The challenge names one command you haven't been taught yet: `grep` in the bash box, or `Get-Acl` in the PowerShell box. Instead of guessing what it does, ask the terminal directly.

### Step 2 — Run the Help Command

In bash, use `grep --help` (or `man grep`). In PowerShell, use `Get-Help Get-Acl`. Read the output, then describe it in your own words.

Command you ran:

```
grep --help
```

What the help text told you the command does, in your own words:

```
search for patterns in each file
```

## Analysis Questions

### Analysis Question 1

Look at the path `pwd` (or `Get-Location`) printed in Part A, Step 1. In this simulator, both the bash and PowerShell boxes use Linux-style paths. Explain what makes this path Linux-style, and describe what a Windows-style path would look like instead. Reference at least one specific detail from Lesson 2 (a drive letter, a slash direction, or the presence of a ~) to support your answer.

```
Linux style, I know this because it uses forward slashes (/) to separate directories, whereas Windows paths use backslashes (\).
```

### Analysis Question 2

In Part B, you ran `pwd`/`Get-Location` right after moving with `cd`, more than once. Explain why that "move, then check" habit matters, especially while you're still building confidence with the command line.

```
Running pwd right after cd builds a habit of verifying that a command actually did what you expected, rather than just assuming it worked. This matters a lot while you're still new to the command line because if you type the wrong folder name or make a typo, you might not immediately notice you're in the wrong place.
```

### Analysis Question 3

In Part C, you looked up a command you'd never used before, instead of guessing or skipping it. Explain why this habit — asking the terminal for help instead of memorizing everything in advance — matters for a real career in IT or cybersecurity.

```
In IT and cybersecurity, it's impossible to memorize every command, flag, or tool in advance since new utilities, syntax, and edge cases show up constantly, and no one can hold it all in their head. Knowing how to quickly and correctly ask a system for help is a core skill in itself, because it means you can figure out unfamiliar tools on the spot instead of freezing or guessing wrong.
```

### Analysis Question 4

Compare this lab to Lesson 1's filing-room analogy (the pile of paper vs. the labeled cabinets). Now that you've actually navigated a file-system tree yourself instead of just reading about one, what — if anything — surprised you or felt different from what you expected?

```
The "labeled cabinets" are the folder structure (intake, logs, maintenance), and moving through them with cd and ls is like walking to a specific cabinet and opening a specific drawer instead of digging through a messy pile. I didnt expect how fast and precise navigating by command becomes once you're not relying on a mouse, or that guessing which folder held the file.
```

## GitHub Commit Subsection

This lab's written answers are submitted the same way as Week 2's: through the **CyberFoundations Lab Portal**, not by typing directly into GitHub.

1. Go to the CyberFoundations Lab Portal and sign in with your student Microsoft account.
2. Open **Week 3 → Lab 01: Navigate Your First File System**.
3. Fill in the worksheet fields — they match the commands, outputs, and questions in this file.
4. Connect your GitHub account if you haven't already (one-time setup), and select your portfolio repo.
5. Click **Submit to GitHub**. The Portal commits the completed file to `week-03/labs/lab-01-command-line-navigation.md` for you — no manual typing or commit needed for this part.

**Three different things — do all that apply:** finishing the simulator challenges saves your challenge progress; **Submit to GitHub** on this worksheet sends your written answers to your repo; logging the lab in the separate lab tracker is its own step (see the Week 3 Submissions Guide).

**📌 Optional — add a screenshot for your portfolio.** This entire step is optional. Skipping it will **not** affect your grade — it's a nice-to-have addition to your portfolio, not a requirement. Only do this if you'd like a visual record of your CLI Simulator session.

If you'd like to add one, take a screenshot showing your commands and their output, then:

1. Go to your portfolio repository on GitHub.com and navigate to `assets/screenshots/week-03/`.
2. Click **Add file → Upload files**, drag in your screenshot, and give it a descriptive name (lowercase, hyphens, no spaces — e.g. `cli-simulator-session.png`).
3. Scroll down and click **Commit changes**.
4. Click on the uploaded image's filename to open it — you'll see the image itself displayed on the page.
5. Right-click directly on the image and choose **Copy image address** (Chrome/Edge) or **Copy Image Link** (Firefox).
6. Come back to this file, open the pencil (edit) icon, and add the embed near the bottom of Part B, pasting your copied link in place of the placeholder:

![CLI Simulator session screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tbbreepenny/breanna-cyberfoundations-portfolio/refs/heads/main/assets/screenshots/week-03/cli-simulator-session.png)

**If right-click doesn't show that option** (e.g., on some trackpads or tablets): click the small download-arrow icon in the top-right of the image preview instead, then copy the URL from your browser's address bar.
