# Week 2 Lab — Cybersecurity Landscape & Digital Infrastructure Overview

**Student Name:** Breanna Pennywell

**Date Completed:** 07/26/2026

**Module:** 1 — Digital Infrastructure & CLI | **Week:** 2  
**Submission Path:** `week-02/labs/lab-01-hardware-os-software-diagram.md`

---

## Overview

In this lab, you build a working mental model of the system you'll be securing throughout this course: the hardware, operating system, and software layers that make up every computer, and where the cybersecurity field fits around them. This lab has two parts. Part A connects this week's material to the CyberFoundations City map. Part B has you build and explain a diagram of how a computer's hardware, OS, and software layers interact.

**No terminal or command line is required this week** — that starts in Week 3.

## Part A — CyberFoundations City & the Cybersecurity Landscape

The CyberFoundations City map is your visual guide to the next 11 weeks. Each district represents a module of this course. This part connects this week's material to the map you were introduced to in Week 1.

### Step 1 — Open the Lab Portal Orientation Module

Log into the Lab Portal with your Microsoft account. From your Student Dashboard, open the **Module 1 orientation** module.

### Step 2 — Complete the Orientation Walkthrough

Work through the orientation content. It covers the same hardware/OS/software material as this week's lessons from a different angle — use it to check your understanding, not to replace the lessons.

### Step 3 — Locate This Week's District on the City Map

Open the CyberFoundations City map (introduced in Week 1, Lesson 6). Identify which district corresponds to Module 1 — Digital Infrastructure & CLI.

**District name:** Foundry District

```
Foundry District
```

**Why this district fits this week's topics (1–2 sentences):** I think it fits because we will be going over digital infrastructure and command line foundations. The district itself represents hardware, and operating systems.

## Part B — Hardware, OS, and Software Diagram

A computer is a stack of layers: physical hardware at the bottom, an operating system managing that hardware in the middle, and the software you actually use on top. This part has you draw that stack and explain it in your own words.

### Step 1 — Identify the Layers

Before drawing anything, list the three layers you'll diagram and one example of what lives at each layer.

**Hardware layer — one example component:** CPU

```
(e.g., CPU, RAM, storage — your choice)
```

**Operating system layer — name an OS:** Linux

```
(e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS)
```

**Software layer — one example application:** Chrome

```
(e.g., a web browser, a word processor)
```

### Step 2 — Sketch Your Diagram

Sketch a simple diagram (hand-drawn and photographed, or built in any digital tool) showing how the hardware, OS, and software layers stack and interact. Arrows or labels showing "what talks to what" matter more than visual polish. If you'd like a free browser-based option instead of hand-drawing, try [draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) — no account required to get started.

### Step 3 — Upload and Embed Your Diagram

Upload your diagram image directly into your repo's assets folder — keep it there rather than pasting it loose into this file, so all of this week's images stay together and organized.

1. Go to your portfolio repository on GitHub.com and navigate to `assets/screenshots/week-02/`.
2. Click **Add file → Upload files**, then drag in your diagram image, and give it a descriptive name (lowercase, hyphens, no spaces, no timestamps — e.g. `hardware-os-software-diagram.png`).
3. Scroll down and click **Commit changes**.
4. Click on the uploaded image's filename to open it — you'll see the image itself displayed on the page.
5. Right-click directly on the image and choose **Copy image address** (Chrome/Edge) or **Copy Image Link** (Firefox).
6. Come back to this file, open the pencil (edit) icon, and paste that link into the embed line below, in place of the placeholder:

```markdown
![Hardware/OS/software diagram](paste your copied image link here)
```

**If right-click doesn't show that option:** click the small download-arrow icon in the top-right of the image preview instead, then copy the URL from your browser's address bar.

**My Diagram:** https://github.com/tbbreepenny/breanna-cyberfoundations-portfolio/blob/main/assets/screenshots/week-02/hardware-os-software-diagram.png?raw=true

### Step 4 — Explain Your Diagram

In your own words — not a copied definition — explain how the three layers interact. Reference your own diagram directly.

```
If this was like a puppet show the CPU would be the puppet, the physical thing that cannot decide on its own and does what it is told to do. The operating system would be the puppeteer telling it what to do. Telling the puppet when to move, pulling the strings. The software doesnt touch the puppet at all, its communicating with the puppeteer and the puppeteer does what it says.
```

## Analysis Questions

Answer each question in your own words. These questions connect what you did in Parts A and B to the bigger picture of this course.

### Analysis Question 1

If the operating system crashed on the computer you diagrammed, which layer(s) would stop working, and which (if any) would keep working? Explain your reasoning.

```
If Linux crashed, both the hardware and software layers would effectively stop working. The CPU would still physically exist and could still execute raw instructions, but without Linux managing memory, scheduling and device access, nothing could happen. Chrome would freeze and crash immediately, since it depends entirely on Linux to handle its requests for memory, file access and network connections.
```

### Analysis Question 2

Pick one piece of software you use daily. Trace it down through the OS to the hardware it ultimately depends on. What would happen to that software if the hardware layer failed?

```
I use Chrome daily, and its dependency chain runs straight down through the layers: Chrome sends requests to Linux (like "open a network socket" or "read this file"), Linux translates those requests into low-level instructions, and the CPU carries them out by moving data and running calculations. If the hardware layer failed, Chrome would stop working completely, along with everything else on the computer, because there'd be no physical component left to execute any instructions at all. This shows that software isn't really independent; it's borrowing capability from the OS and hardware every time it runs.
```

### Analysis Question 3

Explain, in your own words, why a cybersecurity professional needs to understand all three layers — hardware, OS, and software — rather than just the software layer where most visible attacks (like phishing emails) happen.

```
A cybersecurity professional who only understands the software layer would miss huge categories of real-world attacks. Vulnerabilities and exploits can live at any layer. Malicious firmware or hardware backdoors target the hardware layer, privilege escalation and kernel exploits target the OS layer, and phishing or malware target the software layer. Someone who can only reason about the software layer would fail to recognize how an attacker might compromise a system below the application, for example by exploiting the OS to gain control of everything running on top of it. Understanding all three layers means understanding the full attack surface, not just the part that's most visible to end users. This full-stack awareness is what separates a security professional from someone who can only respond to obvious, surface-level threats.

## Lab Report Questions

Answer each question in complete sentences.

**1. What is the cybersecurity landscape, and why does it matter to someone starting this course?**

```
The cybersecurity landscape refers to the full range of systems, threats, technologies, and practices that make up the field — everything from physical hardware and networks to software, data, and the people who use them, along with the attackers who try to exploit weaknesses at any of those points. It matters to someone starting this course because cybersecurity isn't one narrow skill; it's a broad discipline that touches nearly every layer of modern technology, and understanding that landscape early helps a student see where their interests and strengths might fit, whether that's networking, systems administration, incident response, or policy. It also sets realistic expectations: security isn't just "stopping hackers" in the movie sense, it's an ongoing, multi-layered effort across hardware, operating systems, software, and human behavior.
```

**2. Which CyberFoundations City district did you identify in Part A, and how does its theme connect to the hardware/OS/software material in Part B?**

```
I identified the Foundry District, whose theme is building infrastructure fundamentals. This connects directly to the three-layer material in Part B, since hardware, the operating system, and software are themselves the foundational infrastructure that every other district in the city ultimately depends on.
```

**3. Of the three layers (hardware, OS, software), which one do you think is hardest to secure, and why?**

```
OS because it sits in the middle and has to mediate between hardware and every piece of software running on the machine, which makes it a high-value target with a huge attack surface.
```
