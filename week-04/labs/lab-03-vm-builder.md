# Week 4 Lab — Build Your First Virtual Machine (VM Builder Simulator) ★ Deliverable 1

**Student Name:** Breanna Pennywell

**Date Completed:** 10/11/2026

**Module:** 1 — Digital Infrastructure & CLI | **Week:** 4  
**Submission Path:** `week-04/labs/lab-03-vm-builder.md`

## Overview

Lessons 3 and 4 taught you what a virtual machine is and how one lives and dies. This capstone lab hands you the keys: in the VM Builder Simulator you'll provision a machine of your own through the full five-question wizard (Part A), handle whatever provisioning throws at you (Part B), and run the complete lifecycle — stop, start, snapshot, delete — while a billing meter runs (Part C). This lab is the heart of **★ Deliverable 1: VM concepts + CLI screenshots** — its two screenshots join the two from Labs 01 and 02 in your portfolio repo.

**The simulator will push back on purpose.** Taken names, refused passwords, quota limits, and a region that sometimes fails are all part of the exercise — reading an error calmly and fixing the right thing *is* the skill being graded. Errors here are progress, not mistakes.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Environment | CyberFoundations VM Builder Simulator — runs entirely in your web browser; nothing to install, no account needed, no real servers, no real money |
| Prerequisite | Week 4, Lessons 3 and 4 completed; Labs 01 and 02 recommended first |
| Concept Checks | The simulator gates progress on four Concept Checks — all four are covered in Lessons 3 and 4 |
| Time | Plan for 30–45 minutes, including this worksheet |

### How to Open the Simulator — Step by Step

1. Open your web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, or Safari all work — use a computer, not a phone, so your screenshots capture the full screen).
2. Go to this address (you can also click the **VM Builder Simulator** link on the Lab Portal's Week 4 page — same destination):

```
https://cybervisionariesinstitute.github.io/cyberfoundations-simulators/vm-builder.html
```

3. Confirm you're in the right place: you should see a dark purple header reading **"Foundry District Cloud Annex"** and a page titled **"Mission Briefing: Provision Your First Virtual Machine."** If you see anything else, re-check the address.
4. Read the Mission Briefing all the way down — especially the **"How to use this simulator"** box. It explains the six steps, the Concept Checks, and the two screenshot moments.
5. Get your screenshot tool ready before you begin: **Windows:** press `Win + Shift + S` · **Mac:** press `Cmd + Shift + 4`, then drag to capture. You will need it twice, at moments the simulator announces with a 📸 banner.
6. Keep this worksheet open in a **second browser tab**, side by side with the simulator — you'll record answers as you go.

**⚠️ One thing to know before you start:** refreshing the simulator page **resets the entire simulation** — nothing is saved between visits. That's safe (it's a training environment), but capture each screenshot when prompted, before moving on, and don't refresh mid-run unless you want a fresh start.

**Also before you start:** have Lesson 4's Resource Pack open to its Quick Reference page (the lifecycle/billing table). You'll want it.

## Part A — Provision Your Machine

### Step 1 — Name It Like a Professional

Work through the Basics screen: choose a VM name that passes the naming rules *and* would tell a stranger what this machine is for. Note: at least one obvious name is already taken — if you hit **NameNotAvailable**, that's the simulator doing its job; pick another and record what happened.

The name you chose, and whether you hit the taken-name error first:

```
annex-foundry-01 -the name was available 
```

### Step 2 — Choose a Region, and Say Why

Pick a region on the Basics screen. Each option describes a trade-off (latency, capacity). Record your choice and one sentence of reasoning — professionals never pick a region at random.

Your region and your reasoning:

```
Selected Foundry Central since not only it was the closest but my commands would reach the vim the fastest.
```

### Step 3 — Choose Your Guest OS

Pick an operating system and record why. There's no wrong answer, but there is a *reasoned* answer — think about which shell you'd rather manage it with, and what the license fee note tells you.

Your OS choice and reasoning:

```
Linux since I’ve gotten the hang of bash and there is no licensing fee.
```

### Step 4 — Size It, and Do the Money Math

Pick a size tier. Record its specs and hourly rate, then do Lesson 4's monthly reflex: hourly rate × 24 × 30. Would you leave this machine running for a month?

Your size tier, its specs, and its hourly rate:

```
B2s - 2 vCPUs, 4 GB RAM, 64 GB disk - $0.046/hr
```

Your monthly math (rate × 24 × 30):

```
$0.046 x 24 x 30 = $33.12 per month

Only if the VM is serving something I need around the clock. For a lab or a test machine I would stop it when I'm not using it, since the meter keeps running for every hour the VM is in a running state, and $33.12 a month adds up for a machine that sits idle.
```

### Step 5 — Create the Admin Account

Create the administrator username and password. The simulator blocks guessable usernames and refuses weak passwords — if it pushes back, record what it rejected and what you learned from the rejection.

What (if anything) got rejected, and your final username (never record the password):

```
Original password was rejected because it was too simple, so I made it more complex

annex-foundry-admin is the username 
```

### Step 6 — Capture Screenshot 1 (REQUIRED — Deliverable 1)

On the Review & Create screen — before you click Create — take the screenshot the simulator prompts for: your full configuration summary, including the total hourly cost. Name it exactly **`vm-config-summary.png`**. Upload instructions are in the GitHub Commit section.

## Part B — Survive Provisioning

### Step 1 — Create, and Read What Happens

Click **Create Virtual Machine** and watch the provisioning stages. Depending on your Part A choices, provisioning may fail with a readable error — **QuotaExceeded** (your size is bigger than the subscription allows) or **AllocationFailed** (your region ran out of capacity). If it fails: read the error, identify which wizard choice it points at, fix *that one thing*, and retry.

What happened on your first Create attempt (success, or the exact error name):

```
Success 
```

If you hit an error: what it told you, and what you changed:

```
No error
```

### Step 2 — Confirm You're Running

Once provisioning completes, confirm on the dashboard: status **Running**, and the billing meter ticking at the rate your size card promised. Record the rate the meter shows.

The running rate shown on your dashboard:

```
0.046/hr
```

---

## Part C — Run the Full Lifecycle

Complete all four lifecycle tasks on the dashboard, in this order, and answer the simulator's Concept Checks as they appear.

### Step 1 — Stop, and Watch the Meter

Stop (deallocate) your VM. Watch what happens to the billing rate — it should not go to zero. Record the stopped rate and what it's paying for.

The stopped rate, and what a stopped VM still pays for:

```
The stopped rate is $0.002/hr, and a stopped (deallocated) VM still pays for its disk storage, because CPU and RAM billing is paused but the disk still exists whether the machine is on or off.
```

### Step 2 — Start It Again

Start the VM and confirm the full rate resumes. One sentence: where did your files go while it was stopped?

Your one-sentence answer:

```
My files stayed safely on the VM's disk, which kept existing (and billing at $0.002/hr) the whole time the VM was stopped, so they were all still there when the full rate resumed.
```

### Step 3 — Take a Snapshot

Take a snapshot and record its name from the snapshot list. One sentence: what exactly did you just photograph, and when would you be glad you have it?

Snapshot name and your one-sentence explanation:

```
 I photographed the VM's exact disk state at that moment, a saved copy I can roll back to, and it appears in the list as snapshot-1.
```

### Step 4 — Capture Screenshot 2 (REQUIRED — Deliverable 1)

With your VM **Running** and at least one snapshot visible, take the dashboard screenshot. Name it exactly **`vm-dashboard-running.png`**.

### Step 5 — Delete, and Read the Warning

Delete your VM. Read the confirmation dialog before you click — record what it warns you is about to happen, then confirm and record your final total cost from the completion banner.

What the delete warning said, in your own words:

```
The warning said that deleting the VM permanently destroys its virtual disk and everything on it, and there is no undo in a real cloud platform. That is why administrators take snapshots first, since my snapshot means I could rebuild the machine. Deleting is also the only way to stop all billing.
```

Your final simulated cost:

```
9.73
```

## Analysis Questions

**Analysis Question 1.** Your stopped VM kept billing a small amount. Explain the "locker fee" in your own words — what physical thing still exists when a VM is stopped, and why is deletion the only true zero? *(Minimum 2 sentences.)*

```
The locker fee is the small charge a stopped VM keeps paying ($0.002/hr in the simulator) because its virtual disk still exists, the way you keep paying rent on a storage locker even when you aren't using what's inside. CPU and RAM billing stop when the VM is deallocated, but the disk is still a physical thing taking up space on the host's storage, so the provider keeps charging for it. Deleting the VM destroys the disk, which is the only way for that physical thing to stop existing, and so it is the only way billing reaches true zero.
```

**Analysis Question 2.** Lesson 4 revealed that your real Weeks 6–12 lab machines are stamped from golden snapshots your instructor built. Using what you did in Part C, Step 3, explain how a golden snapshot works and why it means every student's machine starts identical. *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
In Part C, Step 3, I took a snapshot, which is a saved copy of the VM's exact state at that moment, so I could roll back to it or rebuild from it. A golden snapshot works the same way: my instructor builds one machine with the right operating system, tools, and settings, snapshots it, and then stamps a copy of that snapshot for every student. Because every Weeks 6-12 lab machine starts from the same saved state, every student begins with identical software and configuration, so nobody loses time to a different setup. It also means that if I break my machine, I can delete it and start again from the same snapshot, which is the same rebuild safety net I saw when the delete warning said my snapshot means I could rebuild.
```

**Analysis Question 3.** If you hit a provisioning error in Part B (or even if you didn't): why do you think this lab *wants* you to encounter errors in a simulator before Week 6 hands you real infrastructure? *(Minimum 2 sentences.)*

```
A simulator lets me make mistakes, like picking the wrong size, leaving a VM running, or hitting a configuration error, without paying real money or damaging real infrastructure. By the time I reach Week 6, I will have already seen what the errors look like and what fixes them, so I can spend my time on the real lab instead of being stuck and worried about cost. Practicing the Stop, Start, Snapshot, and Delete workflow first also builds the habits of watching the meter and taking a snapshot before deleting, which matter even more when real billing is involved.
```

**Analysis Question 4.** Defend your Part A size choice to an imaginary manager watching the budget: why was your tier the right rent for this job, and what would have made you pick a bigger or smaller one? *(Minimum 2 sentences.)*

```
I chose B2s (2 vCPUs, 4 GB RAM, 64 GB disk, $0.046/hr) because it is the size this course's labs assume, and it is enough for small workloads without paying for capacity I won't use. A bigger tier like D2s_v3 ($0.110/hr, about $79.20 a month) would have more than doubled the rate for resources the labs don't need, which a manager watching the budget would not accept. A smaller tier like B1s ($0.012/hr, about $8.64 a month) would have been cheaper, but with only 1 vCPU and 1 GB of RAM it is meant for light testing and tiny workloads, so it could be too slow or run out of memory during the labs, and that wasted time costs more than the savings.
